# Once in a Blue Moon

A data visualization that explores the phrase "once in a blue moon."

## What is a blue moon?

There are [two different definitions of what a blue moon is][1]:

1. The second full moon in a month
2. The third full moon out of four in a season

This visualization explores how often a blue moon occurs under these
different definitions and seeks to elucidate how rare a blue moon
actually is.
